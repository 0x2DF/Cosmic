Credits about are to be given to the original MapleSolaxia staff and other colaborators, as some minor
changes/patches on the game were applied by me.
------------------------------------------------


To run it in Windows 10:
	- Install everything normally;
	- WampServer 2.0 -> change port 80 at "httpd.conf" to another, as it clashes with a Windows
default port.
	- Run MapleStory client using these: "Windows XP (SP2)" & "16-bit color mode";
