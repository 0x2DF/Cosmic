MapleSolaxiaV2

Freelance developer: Ronan C. P. Lana

Credits about are to be given to the original MapleSolaxia staff and other colaborators, as just some minor
changes/patches on the game were applied by myself.

This is a NetBeans 8.0.2 Project. This means that it's easier to install the project via "NetBeans' import
new project using existing code". Once installed, build this project on your machine and run the server using
the "launch.bat" application.


Note that the project uses the IP 25.75.212.150. Therefore, change the IP wherever it applies (Ctrl+f the
entire project) to run properly the program. Eventually, I will change the settings on this repository to run
at localhost (127.0.0.1).
------------------------------------------------


To run it in Windows 10:
	- Install everything normally;
	- WampServer 2.0 -> change port 80 at "httpd.conf" to another, as it clashes with a Windows
default port.
	- Run MapleStory client using these: "Windows XP (SP2)" & "(8 or 16)-bit color mode";
